# ESXi Vulnerability Scan

Once I had my VMWare ESXi server running, I wanted to run a vulnerability scan prior to creating any VMs. To do this, I will be using Tenable. At the time of the ESXi install, the version that was installed was version 7 update 2.

I first logged into Tenable and created a new scan. My ESXi server in on the 10.10.100.40 IP, here I entered the details of the host for the scan:

I satarted the scan:

Why the scan was running, I also had Wireshark running at the same time capturing the traffic. Here I was able to see reference to the CVE within the traffic:

Once the scan completed, this is an overview of what it was able to find:

Lets expand and take a closer look into the what it was able to find on our ESXi server. According to the scan, I have a Critical vulnerability, 2 High, and 2 Medium:

Lets take a closer look at the Critical vulnerability since that is obviously the most conerning. We can also see that it provides us with information on how we can remediate the vulnerability. In this case, this CVE is remediated by apply the patch update 3 for version 7:

I also went to the NVD page to locate the CVE and get more information. I can see that this CVE was recently published:

I also did the same for both High CVEs that were found:

Second Scan after ESXi has been updated:

The path worked, there is not vulns any more. The medium vulns are related to the certificate:
