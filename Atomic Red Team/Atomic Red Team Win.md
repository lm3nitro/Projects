4. Import the module using the following command.
Import-Module "C:\AtomicRedTeam\invoke-atomicredteam\Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.psd1" -Force

$PSDefaultParameterValues = @{"Invoke-AtomicTest:PathToAtomicsFolder"="C:\AtomicRedTeam\atomics"}

5. Once that is imported, we can then check to see if itâ€™s working by using the help command

6. See details of test with the following command:

Invoke-AtomicTest T1055 -ShowDetailsBrief

Here we see all the tests that matches the t1055

We will want to specify a test to see the exact details. In this case I chose T1055-5:
```
Invoke-AtomicTest T1055-5 -ShowDetails
```
<img width="955" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-28 at 9 20 55 PM" src="https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/d2973b06-6348-40b5-85a7-c188fb4e18c2">

7. Check to see if we can run a particular test on the system:
```
Invoke-AtomicTest T1055-5 -CheckPrereqs
```
<img width="558" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-28 at 9 23 20 PM" src="https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/bd1d2bf3-6578-49f7-8690-831facaf21a7">

In this case, all the prereqs are met. If they are not met, you can use the following command:
```
Invoke-AtomicTest T1055-5 -GetPrereqs
```

8. I decided to run the test 
```
Invoke-AtomicTest T1564.002-3
```
This test created a hidden user in registry:

We can see that the test completed successfully.

9. Lets verify our registry key to ensure that the test did create the hidden user:

I also have a wazuh agent installed on this host. Lets take a look and see if the details:

When we expand and see the details, we can see that this event was generated from our test:
