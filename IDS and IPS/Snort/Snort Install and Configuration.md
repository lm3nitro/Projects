# Snort 3

<img width="489" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-27 at 10 54 06 PM" src="https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/31607c9b-9639-470a-8998-d78b77631d4f">

Snort is a powerful open-source tool used for network security. It works like a digital watchdog, constantly monitoring network traffic for signs of suspicious or malicious activity. When it detects something fishy, it creates an alert. This is the initial installation of Snort. 

### Scope:
I will be installing and configuring Snort 3 on a Linux OS. I will then create a basic detection rule for ICMP and will be generating matching traffic from another PC and verifying that Snort triggers expected alerts. I will also be using a PCAP file containing matching traffic to further validate that alerts are being triggered as expected. 

### Tools and Technology:

Linux OS and Snort 3

## Prerequisites

Before I install Snort, I need to ensure that I had the needed prerequisites. There are several that are essential prior to installing Snort.

1. General Prerequisites:

![Pasted image 20240402170138](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/fcf89b37-623c-4aa9-a9b3-29697945392f)

![Pasted image 20240402170208](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/8ebeb2aa-40fe-4171-a07c-d02cc6227db9)

![Pasted image 20240402171429](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/054fcfb0-9332-490e-8f9a-d91d21332f33)

Once Snort was installed, I verified that it was up and running:

> [!NOTE]  
> Snort 3 binary is on /usr/local/bin

![Pasted image 20240402175208](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/7d24a925-6d94-4145-8526-fe19ae949ed2)

Here I can see that it is installed and working:

![Pasted image 20240402175104](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/2fe6afaf-c2ec-4ac1-a959-3bf594f2d261)

I also tested the Snort 3 configuration file:

> [!NOTE]  
> The configuration file is located at /usr/local/etc/snort/snort.lua

```
snort -c /usr/local/etc/snort/snort.lua
```
![Pasted image 20240402175506](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/d7b09f9c-a4da-482d-a29b-6b7cdc80f8b2)

### Optional

This next section is optional. If want to run snort to sniff traffic live on the interface, so it can generate alerts in real time, there are a few things that need to be setup beforehand.

Verify the name of the interface:

![Pasted image 20240402175706](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/51add544-dfac-421c-9ea4-fb6f1480e949)

#### Verify receive offload on the interface:

> [!NOTE]
> Some NIC/driver combinations may disable these offload settings by default,vwhile others enable it by default.vYou should check your sensors now before you get into a situation where you really need that full packet capture and find out that you don't actually have it.Â To check, run ethtool with the "-k" (lower-case k) option on the interface you'd like to check.vFor example, to check ens32:

![Pasted image 20240402175935](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/10a51022-9b49-4b81-bb3e-c747f1b7ffb8)

Temporarily disable interface offload:

> [!NOTE]  
> You can set multiple options in one "ethtool" command, but this can be problematic if your card doesn't support all of the settings. To avoid this, you could invoke ethtool for each option like this:
> ```
> ethtool -K ens32 rx off
> ethtool -K ens32 tx off
> ethtool -K ens32 sg off
> ethtool -K ens32 tso off
> ethtool -K ens32 ufo off
> ethtool -K ens32 gso off
> ethtool -K ens32 gro off
> ethtool -K ens32 lro off
> ```
> Or you could simply wrap the ethtool command in a for-loop like this:
> ```
> for i in rx tx sg tso ufo gso gro lro; do ethtool -K ens32 $i off; done
> ```

![Pasted image 20240402180832](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/847b1ccd-dba7-4cc5-acdb-a684537594c6)

> [!NOTE]  
> These settings will remain in effect only while the OS is booted, so this needs to be applied at every boot. This can be done by adding the above for-loop as a "post-up" command for each of the interfaces in /etc/network/interfaces.

Again, the above mentioned is optional and not needed, but wanted to share. Now that I have snort installed and working, I then proceeded to create some custom rules. 

## Custom Rule:

Before I can get started, I needed to create a directory called rules under /usr/local/etc/ and create a file called local.rules under /usr/local/etc/rules/. This is where I will create custom rules.

```
mkdir /usr/local/etc/rules
nano /usr/local/etc/rules/local.rules
```

![Pasted image 20240402183512](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/0caec5a0-848c-4490-8704-2d6f199cdb32)

To verify that the rule I created was done correctly, I tested the rules against the configuration file:

```
snort -c /usr/local/etc/snort/snort.lua -R /usr/local/etc/rules/local.rules
```

![Pasted image 20240402183701](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/310e4699-f28a-4392-85a9-36fa0a106e5a)

I then ran Snort on the interface for rule testing. Since the rule that I created was for ICMP, I tested against it with a ping:

![Pasted image 20240402184234](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/4a3747fe-9cd6-4099-b12f-d0e17c376986)

```
snort -c /usr/local/etc/snort/snort.lua -R /usr/local/etc/rules/local.rules -i ens32 -A alert_fast
```

![Pasted image 20240402184126](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/e6d712d4-08d5-49d9-83e4-63b4781a1f2b) 

Making the local.rules persistent makes it so that I don't have to specify the location of my local rules.

Remove -- to enable the option:
```
 -- enable_builtin_rules = true,
```
Adding:
```
 include= "/usr/local/etc/rules/local.rules", 
```
Save the configuration file and test:

![Pasted image 20240402184804](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/1b8e391e-25a6-4972-b88c-a3bacb753c7b)

Now I can run the configuration file again without specifying the location of the local.rules:

![Pasted image 20240402185426](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/e5d0e28c-5b4c-4b43-8598-299a980857bb)

```
snort -c /usr/local/etc/snort/snort.lua -i ens32 -A alert_fast
```

![Pasted image 20240402185237](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/4fc959cb-e7ca-4ed1-9a4e-07d012722b93)

## Running Snort 3 against a pcap file:

Running pcaps against Snort can help with several things:

+ Testing and Tuning
+ Incident Analysis
+ Rule Development
+ Benchmarking and Performance Testing
+ And so much more...

```
snort -c /usr/local/etc/snort/snort.lua -r icmp.pcap -A alert_fast -q
```

![Pasted image 20240402185922](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/e2cc0fd8-aa72-439f-b3d6-637571c3dcf5)

Next, I wanted to permanently disable interface offloading. This can significantly impact Snort's performance and accuracy. When offloading is disabled, Snort can analyze packets in their true state, leading to better detection.

```
Disable LRO & GRO using a service
```
>#### Note: Create a file under /bin/systemd/system/

Enable the service:

```

## PulledPork

The following is also optional and not needed. PulledPork is an opensource perl script that can automate the process of downloading, processing, and organizing Snort rules. It also ensures that Snort stays up to date with the latest threat intelligence. 

```
git clone https://github.com/shirkdog/pulledpork3.git 
cd ~/snort/pulledpork3 
sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin/pulledpork3 
sudo cp pulledpork.py /usr/local/bin/pulledpork3 
sudo cp -r lib/ /usr/local/bin/pulledpork3 
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pulledpork3/pulledpork.py 
sudo mkdir /usr/local/etc/pulledpork3 
sudo cp etc/pulledpork.conf /usr/local/etc/pulledpork3/
```

### Summary:

Overall, I have enjoyed having snort running on my network. Again, this is an excellent tool to have in your network, or at least installed in a lab environment. Having this in my network has allowed me to learn more and dive deeper into threat detection, attack patterns, and network anomalies in a practical way. 

Configuring and analyzing alerts generated from Snort allowed me to gain deep insights into the structure and behavior of network traffic, including and not limited to protocols, packet structures, and common communication patterns. With time, having Snort in my network helped me to better identify normal and anomalous traffic patterns and ultimately enhanced my ability to spot irregularities that may indicate malicious activity. 

I highly recommend having Snort 3 installed and running due to its advanced performance, comprehensive threat detection, and ease of use. This is a great tool to have added to the arsenal to strengthen network security.
