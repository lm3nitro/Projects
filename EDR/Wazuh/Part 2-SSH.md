# Part 2- SSH Brute Force Simulation Attack

This is part 2 of the project. In Part 1, I installed and configured the Wazuh management server and agents. I will be simulating a SSH brute force attack against the Linux host that has the Wazuh agent installed. While the simulation attack has been performed, I will be analyzing the traffic pertaining to the attack in the target server logs, Wireshark and in the Wazuh management server. 

## Installing OpenSSH

I will first begin by installing openssh on the target host with the Wazuh agent.

```
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

Verified that SSH is running:

```
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

Enabled SSH persistence after reboot

```
sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

Checked for listening SSH service

```
sudo ss -tnlp
```

## Attacking

Once SSH was installed on the target host, I then moved to the attacking host to perform the SSH brute-force attack. I will be using Hyrda to perform the attack along with a list of user and password wordlist:

+ -l specifies a username during a brute force attack.
+ -L specifies a username wordlist to be used during a brute force attack.
+ -p specifies a password during a brute force attack.
+ -P specifies a password wordlist to use during a brute force attack.
+ -t set to 4, which sets the number of parallel tasks (threads) to run.

## Analysis

While the attack is running on the target host, lets check the logs on the target server. Here we can see many login attempts. We also see the 'error: maximum authentication attempts exceeded ...'. This could be a user that has forgotten their password, or it can be seen as malicious activity.

While performing the brute force attack, I also had Wireshark running on the target host. Here is a look at what was captured. I was able to see the protocol SSH and many key exchanges:

Next, I took a look at the Wazuh management server to see if it was able to detect the attack/malicious activity. I was able to see 548 authentication attempts and all coming from SSH authentication login attempts. With this many login attempts in a short period of time, we can determine that this is a brute force attack and not just a forgotten password by a legitimate user:

Upon analysis, I went back to the attacking host and was able to see the the attack completed and it was successful in finding the user and password:

### Summary:

In this simulation attack, I installed OpenSSH on the target Linux host that had the Wazuh agent installed and was also running Wireshark throughout the duration of the attack. While the attack was running, I was able to analyze the Wireshark traffic capture and the server logs where I was able to see the failed login attempts and authentication errors. Being able to identify these attack patterns is crucial for understanding attack behaviors and identifying threats. Having the Wazuh agent also show cased the importance of having continuous traffic monitoring to help identify unauthorized access attempts promptly, and have real-time security solutions.
