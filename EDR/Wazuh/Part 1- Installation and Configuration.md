Wazuh is a free and open-source security monitoring platform. Wazuh collects, normalizes, and analyzes log data from various sources such as Operating System, applications, and network devices. It provides real-time correlation, context, and response for security events and incidents, as well as cloud environments and management.

Listed below are some core functionalities of Wazuh: 

+ Intrusion Detection
+ Log Management
+ File Integrity Monitoring
+ Vulnerability Detection
+ Security Compliance

### Scope:

Evaluate the effectiveness and detection capabilities of Wazuh by installing it and an agent on both on a Win 10 and Linux OS and simulating cyber-attacks to observe and analyze the alerts generated by Wazuh. This will be divided into different parts:

+ Part 1: Installation and configuration
+ Part 2: SSH Brute Force with Hydra
+ Part 3: RDP Brute Force

This is Part 1 and will focus on installing Wazuh and the deployment of agents. 

### Tools and Technology:

Ubuntu 22.04, Win 10, Wazuh, and PowerShell

## Installation:

To get started, I used the curl command to install Wazuh 4.7.3:

Once installed, I checked the status of the Wazuh server:

```
systemctl status wazuh-manager
```

![Pasted image 20240428140610](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/442e9145-2801-424f-9684-41f6b117a26e)

Next, I restarted the Wazuh manager server:

```
systemctl restart wazuh-manager
```

I then verified the IP of the Wazuh server:

![Pasted image 20240428133459](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/4f0e3afa-2d74-4fac-b530-d3eab7f5514d)

Now that I know the IP; I can navigate to it and login:

![Pasted image 20240428133706](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/2dda9435-acb1-430d-8165-04b5a26d2628)

## Win 10 OS Agent:

I have the Wazuh server up and running, I now need to install the agent. I will be installing it on a Win 10 OS. To do this I selected *Add agent*

![Pasted image 20240428134105](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/7f22eccd-e4c5-43e0-84f8-b9494fc2dfe0)

I then selected the Windows OS, entered the server IP, and agent name. This will generate a command that can be used to install the agent:

![Pasted image 20240428134352](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/22fb45c4-11c3-4cd0-83ec-e93137883e92)

Once that was completed, I went to the host where I will install the agent and opened PowerShell as Admin:

![Pasted image 20240428134509](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/3a0608f2-7f9a-4c45-84bb-16f89635e78d)

I pasted the Wazuh generated command in PowerShell:

![Pasted image 20240428134550](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/11383642-9b2e-45d4-a447-4e82e5383fd1)

Downloaded the agent:

![Pasted image 20240428134628](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/9ecdbf7a-fab4-4486-9ead-5cb88914114c)

Started the service:

![Pasted image 20240428134733](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/87ba671b-b575-417a-a23e-e4e8c0d4b2fb)

To restart the service the following command can be used:

```
Restart-Service wazuh 
```

Checked the service:

![Pasted image 20240428135323](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/1d7a8b06-6e2f-4f87-9691-240b7c1b68a5)

Verified the network connection:

![Pasted image 20240428135824](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/898ab9bc-3e5b-4f39-91cd-fb3bf89ca56b)

![Pasted image 20240428140327](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/442d1863-ff92-44ae-8d83-6bdc4b4be00a)

Now that I installed the agent, I went back to Wazuh manager server to verify:

![Pasted image 20240428135034](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/fa78f0b2-b29b-43fa-b679-105e848bc9bb)

![Pasted image 20240428135201](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/f7638f52-9ac0-433c-abb0-aef4ce5efe2a)

I can also see security events being generated from our Win 10 agent:

![Pasted image 20240428141534](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/11fee0ee-8a86-4977-8d9c-df4e5cbb4a93)

## Linux Agent:

For my Linux agent, I will be installing it on a host running Ubuntu. To do this I navigated to the window to add agent and select the same parameters as I did with the Win 10, only this time for Linux:

![Pasted image 20240428155628](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/60b6275f-d87d-498a-8012-e2554533db75)

Once that was compelted, I downloaded the agent:

```
wget https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/apt/pool/main/w/wazuh-agent/wazuh-agent_4.7.3-1_amd64.deb && sudo WAZUH_MANAGER='10.10.100.47' WAZUH_AGENT_NAME='sql_lm3nitro_database' dpkg -i ./wazuh-agent_4.7.3-1_amd64.deb
```

![Pasted image 20240428155752](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/34449676-8166-4739-bf2b-4e894eb4a51c)

Next, I enabled the agent:

```
sudo systemctl start wazuh-agent
sudo systemctl enable wazuh-agent
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

![Pasted image 20240428155913](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/fa96ec13-37a4-4d64-b2e7-5d72757f4df1)

Verified connectivity:

![Pasted image 20240428160241](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/33e5eaaa-6790-4a0d-9d8a-b416416520a6)

![Pasted image 20240428160441](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/2e4c7fac-cb35-4875-b678-e9e1444339d5)

I went back to the Wazuh management server and could see the newly installed agent: 

![Pasted image 20240428160544](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/b6106dc5-49fa-40ff-9d53-b41a4147a2e5)

I also verified that security events were getting generated from the Linux agent:

![Pasted image 20240428160701](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/b4afb69f-5eff-4de7-b0c2-847ff2dc42f3)

A look at the raw logs:

![Pasted image 20240428161502](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/a1fb98e0-4eb0-437c-b1f2-3ea66fc2a4c4)

## Activating Vulnerability Module

The Vulnerability Module is a component of the Wazuh security platform designed to identify and manage vulnerabilities within a network. By leveraging the Wazuh vulnerability module, I was able to gain deeper insights into the security state of our agents and enhance our threat detection and response. 

The files that are needed to modify Wazuh are oin /var/ossec/

Let's navigate there:

```
cd /var/ossec/
```

![Pasted image 20240428162723](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/56e4cb7b-8f30-472a-8ed5-284010d3eb99)

I then used nano to modify the ossec.conf file:

```
nano ossec.conf
```

![Pasted image 20240428163614](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/9013a186-9fa9-4ab3-9bde-17ba234cf29c)

Set the Vulnerability-detector to *Enabled*

![Pasted image 20240428163608](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/32b37077-6198-4855-a79f-a49f91084802)

I then saved the file and changes made and restarted the Wazuh manager:

![Pasted image 20240428163922](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/ee09ff7b-f199-4e5b-9fdd-9991344b2602)

Restarting Agents:

>#### Note: It needs admin privileges to restart the services both on Linux and windows.

Ubuntu 22.04

### Summary:

I installed and configured Wazuh management server and added 2 agents (Win 10 and Ubuntu 22.04). I also enabled the vulnerability detection module on the Wazuh server which will provide more information and a comprehensive visibility. By completing these initial steps, I can now begin the attack simulation phase, where the effectiveness of the Wazuh set-up will be tested and analyzed.
