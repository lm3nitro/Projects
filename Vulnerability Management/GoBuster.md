If you look at the help command, we can see that Gobuster has a few modes.

    dir — Directory enumeration mode.
    dns — Subdomain enumeration mode.
    fuzz — Fuzzing mode.
    s3 — S3 enumeration mode.
    vhost — Vhost enumeration mode.

### Downloading a Wordlist:

To download the wordlist that I will be using, I went to crackstation.net:

This wordlist is extensive as it is 15GB in size

Here it is in my Downloads directory

### Scanning directories on the web server:

How to use directory mode (dir)

Gobuster's directory mode helps us to look for hidden files and URL paths. This can include images, script files, and almost any file that is exposed to the internet.

Here is the command to run the dir mode:

On this scan I used the common.txt wordlist

sudo ./gobuster dir -u http://192.168.91.129 -w ~/Downloads/common.txt

Looking at some of  directories requested by gobuster from the wordlist.txt

Looking at 3 new hidden directories found by gobuster running against the 15G wordlist not included in the list above.. More would have been found, but I stopped the process due to the size.

# How to Defend Against Gobuster:



Gobuster is a remarkable tool that you can use to find hidden directories, URLs, sub-domains, and S3 Buckets.

But this enables malicious hackers to use it and attack your web application assets as well. So how do we defend against Gobuster?

# You can use the following steps to prevent and stop brute-force attacks on your web application.

Audit yourself: 

Use Gobuster on your own applications and perform an audit. This will help you find the information that will be visible to the attackers.

Apply security policies:

To prevent resources like S3 from being exposed on the internet, use AWS bucket policies to prevent unauthorized access.

Use bot protection solutions:

Bot protection services like Cloudflare will stop any brute-force attacks making it incredibly difficult to attack your web application.
