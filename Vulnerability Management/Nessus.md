## Vulnerability Scanning

The process of detecting, assessing, and reporting on security defects and vulnerabilities is known as vulnerability scanning. Automated vulnerability scanning technologies are used to identify potential risk exposures and attack vectors throughout an organization’s networks, hardware, software, and systems. The scanning and assessment of vulnerabilities is a critical phase in the vulnerability management lifecycle.


# Nessus:

Nessus is a  security scanning tool, which scans a computer and raises an alert if it discovers any vulnerabilities that malicious hackers could use to gain access to any computer you have connected to a network.

# Creating a Basic Network Scan:


A Basic Network Scan will perform similarly to an Advanced Network Scan. The only difference being that Advanced Network Scan:

- Allows the fine-tuning of the plugins included in the scan
- Has some different default settings
- Allows audits to be added to it

The Basic Network Scan is a great policy for the average network scan.

The Advanced Network Scan allows for a lot more customization to tailor fit a policy against a host or range of hosts

# Vulnerability Metrics

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a method used to supply a qualitative measure of severity. CVSS is not a measure of risk. CVSS v2.0 and CVSS v3.x consist of three metric groups: Base, Temporal, and Environmental. The Base metrics result in a numerical score ranging from 0 to 10, which can then be modified by assessing the Temporal and Environmental metrics. A CVSS assessment is also represented as a vector string, a compressed textual representation of the values used to derive the score.

The scanner was able to find a  Bind shell on the host: 


 Simply a Bash shell that is _bind_ to port `1524/tcp`. It will run everything sent to that port on Bash and reply with the output. You don't need tools like Metasploit for that; a simple Netcat or Telnet will do.

# Remediation: 

Vulnerability remediation is the process of finding, addressing, and neutralizing security vulnerabilities  within an organization’s IT environment, which can include computers, digital assets, networks, web applications, and mobile devices.

Remediation is one of the most important steps in the vulnerability management process , which is critical for securing networks, preventing data loss, and enforcing business continuity.
