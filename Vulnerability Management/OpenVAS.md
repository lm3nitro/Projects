# $${\color{green}OpenVAS}$$

![Pasted image 20240423141319](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/d3705acd-bd4d-4684-aab8-ab72d7c8a0d5)

OpenVAS is an open-source vulnerability scanner used to scan computer systems and networks. It helps identify weaknesses that could be exploited by the adversary while also providing detailed reports and recommendations. Its capabilities include unauthenticated and authenticated testing, various high-level and low-level internet and industrial protocols, and performance tuning for large-scale scans. 

### Scope: 

I will be installing OpenVAS and will be scanning a web server running Apache2. I will also be monitoring on the web server with Wireshark to see the traffic generated by OpenVAS while scanning. I will also cover the findings of the report and the recommended remediation. 

### Tools and Technologies:
Linux OS, OpenVAS, Apache2 and Wireshark

## Installing Postgresql

To get started we will first need to install Postgresql. We can install it via the following command:

```
sudo apt install postgresql
```

## Adding Repository:

Next, we will need to install the repository:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mrazavi/gvm
```

Select *Yes*

![Pasted image 20240423150547](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/5eee0f7b-b41e-44a0-8365-44cd8dcf4f32)

![Pasted image 20240423150616](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/b98373f4-2e80-4725-8edc-7ab3024f3510)

Click on *Localhost* and then select *Ok*

![Pasted image 20240423150856](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/72080701-1db9-4d83-a98c-0fe972373a48)

Click on *Yes*

![Pasted image 20240423150927](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/9589adce-fb59-404f-aca8-fc6980dacd31)

## Installing gvm:

We can now install GVM (OpenVAS):

```
sudo apt install gvm
```

![Pasted image 20240423133511](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/fd09e2e8-309f-4a7b-b690-a324f2476640)

Once that has been installed, we will need to create the notus directory. This can be done using the following commands:

```
sudo mkdir /var/lib/notus
sudo chown gvm:gvm /var/lib/notus
```

Last but not least, we need to synchronize the greenbone nvt/cert/scap data. This will ensure everything is up to date. You can do that with the following commands:

1. Synchronize nvt

```
sudo -u gvm -g gvm greenbone-nvt-sync
```

![Pasted image 20240423133602](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/a8b22b8d-531e-430e-ab51-d46ea5c47f84)

2. Synchronize SCAP

```
sudo -u gvm -g gvm greenbone-feed-sync-legacy --type SCAP
```

![Pasted image 20240423134657](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/b1ab685f-12d1-4266-8c8b-992b12e1ab3b)

3. Synchronize GVMD_DATA

```
sudo -u gvm -g gvm greenbone-feed-sync-legacy --type GVMD_DATA
```

![Pasted image 20240423134554](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/fe4bd50a-16eb-4303-922b-960e1d726c08)

>#### Optional: You can always removeNVT db if needed and rebuild it.

```
export $(sudo cat /etc/default/gvmd-pg)
sudo -E -u gvm -g gvm gvmd --rebuild
```

## Accessing OpenVAS

To access the Greenbone Security Assistant web interface, I can use the following 

```
https://lm3nitro.openvas.vuln.local:9392
```
