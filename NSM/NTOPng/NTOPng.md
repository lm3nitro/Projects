# Ntopng

![Pasted image 20240518165048](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/468e6695-e262-453d-a570-c5b13634c626)

Ntopng is a network traffic monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into network usage and performance. It captures and analyzes traffic to help identify bandwidth usage, detect network anomalies, and monitor the behavior of network devices. It supports various protocols and integrates with other tools, making it a valuable asset for network management and security. 

### Scope:

I have added a topology to better demonstrate what my set up will be for this scenario. I will have a network tap that will be listening to all traffic going north and south. I will then install and configure Ntopng. Ntopng will have a sniffing interface set that will be connected to network tap. In the network I will also have a vulnerable PC that I will be monitoring and performing vulnerability scans. I will also be using one of the features that Ntopng offers to capture live traffic and download the pcap to view it in Wireshark.

Objectives: 
+ Monitor and analyze network traffic to and from a vulnerable PC
+ Identify unusual traffic patterns that could indicate a security issue
+ Understand how attackers might exploit services and how network monitoring can help in the early detection of such attempts

### Tools and Technology:

Ubuntu, Ntopng, VMWare ESXi,and Wireshark 

## Getting started/Prerequisites

Before installing anything, I started off by first ensuring the everything is up to date.

```
sudo apt update && upgrade -y
```

![Pasted image 20240518172238](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/3aacf6fc-fa8e-4f2d-8b46-627b160d826a)

Following the command, I was presented with an error stating that the upgrade command had not been installed on the host. I went ahead and installed it:
```
apt updade -y
```
![Pasted image 20240518172309](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/7736267e-5631-481c-9e87-9463b1fcfd43)

Once the OS was completely up to date, I then needed to enable the universe repository:
```
sudo add-apt-repository universe
```

## Installation 

After the prerequisites were completed, I then downloaded the latest stable version of ntopng on Ubuntu 20.04.
```
wget https://packages.ntop.org/apt-stable/20.04/all/apt-ntop-stable.deb
```
![Pasted image 20240518173505](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/e1bbd80e-a3d8-4b03-8df5-70a57b359bf7)

Installing the package:

Note: It automatically added the ntopng repository.

![Pasted image 20240518173716](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/be15ac57-d1dd-4e62-bcbf-a6c0fc0a078e)

Update the package again:

![Pasted image 20240518173836](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/61694731-9dd1-4141-8e29-3d328bceb8ce)

Install ntopng:
```
sudo apt install pfring-dkms ndpi nprobe ntopng n2disk cento
```
![Pasted image 20240518173909](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/586e4d29-a9ff-4da2-9853-c68bcd2ad79c)

Verify the Ntopng version running:
```
ntopng --version
```
![Pasted image 20240518174042](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/a62d8a3d-5af3-4d3b-9a15-ed3717369649)

To check the status, the following command can be used:
```
sudo systemctl status nprobe cento ntopng pf_ring
```

![Pasted image 20240518174159](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/802dc199-a371-4913-b5ec-a35cfc76d5e4)

![Pasted image 20240518174336](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/4d64e168-f6cc-4a40-80b1-8de15e80baf1)

>#### Note: If a service isnâ€™t running, start it with systemctl. For example, the centos service is inactive (dead), I need to restart it with:
>```
>sudo systemctl restart cento
>sudo systemctl status cento
>```

![Pasted image 20240518174435](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/5e27bb23-894c-433e-a4ad-22a9947eacd3)

Next, I verified that the port was listening. By default, ntopng listens on port 3000.
```
sudo ss -lnpt | grep 3000
```
![Pasted image 20240518174553](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/65f244c3-d494-4432-8f9d-9872a44d564c)

In order to navigate to the interface, I needed to verify the IP address. Based on the output, the web user interface is available at the http://10.10.100.113:3000

![Pasted image 20240518192114](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/bfb7c7c6-0d35-4435-b72c-1e482b86fa23)

## Adding and Configuring sniffing interface ens33

I then needed to ass and configure the sniffing interface. To do this, I edited the file located uder /etc/netplan/

![Pasted image 20240518191820](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/46854a9d-dc80-4e25-b133-c2aaff8939df)

I disabled dhcp client:

![Pasted image 20240518191720](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/a0b0be91-6b59-4baf-b874-9243c991af75)

I then saved and applied the changes and verified the interface:

![Pasted image 20240518192013](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/8a7454df-45ae-4191-912c-ea0f4cb3a85d)

![Pasted image 20240518192205](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/376416d6-499f-4adf-befa-acd1c4c74ddf)

To configure the interface in promiscuous mode use, I used the following:
```
ip link set ens33 off
ip link set ens33 promisc on
ip link set ens33 up
```

I also wanted it to be persistent even after rebooting. To do this, I added the following lines to the /etc/rc.local file:
```
ifconfig ens33 up
ifconfig ens33 promisc
```

You can also disable offloading by adding the following:
```
ethtool -K eth0 rx off
ethtool -K eth0 tx off
ethtool -K eth0 sg off
ethtool -K eth0 tso off
ethtool -K eth0 ufo off
ethtool -K eth0 gso off
ethtool -K eth0 gro off
ethtool -K eth0 lro off 
```

Or just one line:
```
for i in rx tx sg tso ufo gso gro lro; do ethtool -K ens33 $i off; done
```

I then verified the interface:

![Pasted image 20240518193143](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/49d3ccfb-5852-4012-895f-718b68f9d724)

## Accessing Ntopng

Once verified, I went to access the web interface:

![Pasted image 20240518174838](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/0e420a71-21d6-41f1-90b7-8f344fcb08ec)

Once logged in, it will allow you to see the sniffing interface, in my case interface ens33 on left side conner:

![Pasted image 20240518193355](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/8f0c373c-10fa-4834-9800-f363d3647e6e)

After 30 minutes had passed, I could see more traffic:

![Pasted image 20240518193336](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/02f0cf9a-dd78-4df6-96a5-c989318e17a9)

For this project, I will be simulating traffic from a vulnerable host that is in my network. Taking a look at the live traffic:

![Pasted image 20240518193657](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/c5feea47-9326-4e29-b738-014443340d0c)

## Ntopng Features

One of the many features on Ntopng, is that it provides an IP blacklist. In this example we can see the IP that has been blacklisted and provided the link to verify the IP in VirusTotal and AbuseIP DB:

![Pasted image 20240518194957](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/142129ea-c455-40c6-9e53-9414414ee044)

I took one as an example as shown above. When checking with VirusTotal, I was able to see the following:

![Pasted image 20240518193915](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/d568b1a8-1953-48a0-a19a-8acea28da626)

## Visibility

Ntopng offers extensive network visibility. The visibility features include detailed views of network hosts, protocols, traffic flows, and geographic information about where network traffic originates and terminates. Below is a view at some of these features:

>#### Note: Ntopng also allows you to detect active network scans. Because the ntopng server is connected to the network tap that is directly connected to my Firewall, it can also see all the scans as they happen live:

Example view of the traffic that is being monitored:

![Pasted image 20240518194736](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/db5938dd-704c-4d2b-a690-b5669d2d9c56)

Detecting abnormal live outbound traffic on strange port number:

## Vulnerability Scan

Once I explored some of the visibility features that Ntopng offers, I continued to perform the scan again my vulnerable host in the network. To do this I navigated Vulnerability Scan on the console and initiated a new scan against the host on 192.168.91.129.

![Pasted image 20240518203909](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/b879bdc7-4641-4172-a2ad-c72230b5242d)

Once the scan started, I started to see that it had already started to detect vulnerabilities:

![Pasted image 20240518204149](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/fe92a4c1-530f-49b0-bb2b-eaaf46f88114)

## Vulnerability Scan Analysis

Once the scan was completed, I downloaded the report to extract the details on what it was able to find from the vulnerable host. 

![Pasted image 20240518205219](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/03058558-5e90-41cb-8a17-1c911b2d53aa)

Here is the report. As seen, it was able to find several CVEs and also provided insights into that they are:

![Pasted image 20240518204543](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/50c8435c-8628-439c-b987-ee4f845b704e)

I wanted to dig a bit deeper and research CVE-1999-0661 from the report. Looking at the CVE, this is a critical CVE with a base score of 10.

![Pasted image 20240518204648](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/6d9ae2c2-1828-47c7-ba03-b1b1a8c64e7f)

I then looked at the telemetry information for interface ens33 (sniffing interface) to see the traffic that was generated from the scan:

![Pasted image 20240518205141](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/ac07ca9f-3764-4655-8e2c-b2bca87bf27d)

## Traffic Analysis

Next, I took a look at the network traffic and was able to see the top talkers, hosts, applications, and traffic classification. 

![Pasted image 20240518210644](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/c4a4df4e-c505-4c15-97cb-1c16d5feb993)

When you filter down to a specific IP, Ntopng offers a lot of information such as ASN, links to external sources for IP lookup (VirusTotal & AboutIP DB), traffic sent/received, CVEs, etc...

![Pasted image 20240518210743](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/da543f7a-3e2a-4228-96fd-4859ea1802f5)

Another great feature that Ntopng offers is that it allows you to capture traffic of live traffic. Here I selected another IP address and downloaded the pcap:

![Pasted image 20240518205941](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/d949415b-b21a-4c65-b4b4-3dcdf050eaee)

As the capture was running, I was able to the live traffic associated with these IPs:

![Pasted image 20240518210859](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/d1f839c6-d88e-407a-aa9b-67138b2f3c7a)

I then looked at one of the pcaps in wireshark to see the traffic:

![Pasted image 20240518210337](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/6c8fcbb9-fb8e-44fd-9272-5c3b72168d0f)

### Summary:

I really enjoyed using and exploring the features that Ntopng had to offer. In doing this project, I was able to familiarize myself with real-time network traffic monitoring and analysis and better understand how network monitoring can be an effective part of network defense. By monitoring this vulnerable host, I was able to run a vulnerability scan, export the report on the scan and gain visibility into the CVEs. Ntopng also allowed me to gain a closer look at the incoming and outgoing traffic from the network. This visibility provided information on the communicating hosts and any potential scans that might occur from the outside. I was also able to learn the following:

+ Learned how normal network traffic behaves and how deviations from this norm (such as sudden spikes in traffic or unusual protocols) might indicate a potential security incident.
+ By using the geo map feature, I was able to track traffic back to its geographical origin, gaining insight into whether traffic is coming from legitimate or suspicious locations.
+ I was able to monitor bandwidth usage, which helped identify inefficient use of network resources, which could improve overall network performance.

Overall, I highly recommend Ntopng for those who want an easy-to-use, powerful tool for monitoring, securing, and optimizing their network infrastructure.
