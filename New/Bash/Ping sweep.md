## Introduction

I created the following script that sends an ICMP request (ping) to devices in a network to determine which hosts are online and responsive, providing a quick assessment of the network's status. This is useful to ensure that all devices are functioning properly, identify potential issues, and maintaining network reliability.

## Use Cases:

+ For critical infrastructure or services, regular pings can ensure that essential systems remain online and accessible.
+ When changes are made to network configurations or security settings, pinging can quickly verify that devices are still operational.

## Script

Below is the script I created. Here I am scanning all the devices in my network (10.10.100.0/24). I am then taking the output and modifying it to display only the relevent information I am interested seeing by using grep:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Local Area Network:
LOCAL_SUBNET="10.10.100"

# CDIR_NET:10.10.100.0/24
# First: 10.10.100.1
# Last: 10.10.100.254
# Broadcast: 10.10.100.255
# Mask: 255.255.255.0

#Looping trough the LOCAL_SUBNET using {}
for IP in $(seq 1 254); do
    ping -c 1 "$LOCAL_SUBNET.$IP" | grep "bytes from" | cut -d " " -f 4 | cut -d ":" -f 1 & # Runs each ping in the background
done
# Waiting for all ping background jobs to finish before exiting
wait
```

Here is another view of the script in VS Code. After executing the script, this is the output that it provides, a clear view of all the IPs that reponded to the ping:

While running the script, I was also capturing the traffic in real time. Here is a view of the traffic. This log can then be used for further analysis, inventory tracking, and troubleshooting.

## Summary

Going through this exercise allowed me to see valuable insights into my networkâ€™s health and device status. This practice is essential for security as it helps identify unauthorized devices, detect anomalies in network behavior, and ensure that critical systems remain operational.
