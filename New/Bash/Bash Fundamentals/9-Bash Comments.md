# Bash Comments

In Bash, comments are used to explain or annotate code, making it easier to understand. Comments are ignored by the shell during execution. Hereâ€™s how comments can be used in a Bash script:

1. Single-Line Comments:

To create a single-line comment by starting the line with a `#` symbol:

```bash
# This is a single-line comment
echo "Hello, World!"  # This comment follows a command
```

2, Multi-Line Comments:

While Bash does not have a built-in multi-line comment feature like some other programming languages, it can be similated using a combination of `: '...'` or `<< 'COMMENT' ... COMMENT` syntax.

Method 1: Using `:`

```bash
: '
This is a multi-line comment.
It will not be executed.
'
```

### Example Script with Comments:

```bash

#!/bin/bash

# This script greets the user

# Prompt for user input
read -p "Please enter your name: " name

: '
The following line will greet the user
and display the current date and time.
'
echo "Hello, $name! Today is $(date)."

# End of the script

```
