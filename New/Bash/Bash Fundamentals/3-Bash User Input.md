# Bash User Input

In Bash, users can be prompted for input using the `read` command. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt for user input
echo "Please enter your name:"
read name

# Output the input
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

### Additional Options:

1. It's also possible to use `-p` with `read` to combine the prompt and input into one line:

```bash
read -p "Please enter your name: " name
```

2. Handling Multiple Inputs:

To read multiple values in one line, you can do:

```bash
read -p "Enter your first and last name: " first last
echo "First: $first, Last: $last"
```

Example:

Once I typed my name, I hit enter, and got the following output:
