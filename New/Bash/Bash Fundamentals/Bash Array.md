The main thing that you need to know is that unlike variables, arrays can hold several values under one name.

You can initialize an array by assigning values divided by space and enclosed in (). 

Example:

```
my_array=("value 1" "value 2" "value 3" "value 4")
```

To access the elements in the array, you need to reference them by
their numeric index.

### Notice:  Keep in mind that you need to use curly brackets.

#### Accessing Array Elements:


Access a single element, this would output: value 2

```
echo ${my_array[1]}
```

Example:

This would return the last element: value 4

```
echo ${my_array[-1]}
```

As with command line arguments using @ will return all elements in the array, as follows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash


#Creating an array:

my_array=("lm3nitro" "bash" "python" "powershell")

#Printing my_array:

echo "${my_array[@]}"
```

#### Length of the Array:

Pretending the array with a hash sign (#) would output the total number of elements in the array, in our case it is 4:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

#Creating an array:

my_array=("lm3nitro" "bash" "python" "powershell" "php" "java")

#Printing my_array:

echo "${#my_array[@]}"
```

### Adding Elements:

You can add elements to an existing array:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#Creating an array:

my_array=("lm3nitro" "bash" "python" "powershell" "php" "java")

#Add a new element

my_array+=(golang)

#Printing my_array:

#Looping Through my_array:

for array in "${my_array[@]}";do

echo $array

done

```

### Array Slicing:

While Bash doesn't support true array slicing, you can achieve similar results using a combination of array indexing and string slicing:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
array=("A" "B" "C" "D" "E")
# Print entire array
echo "${array[@]}" # Output: A B C D E
# Access a single element
echo "${array[1]}" # Output: B
# Print a range of elements (requires Bash 4.0+)
echo "${array[@]:1:3}" # Output: B C D
# Print from an index to the end
echo "${array[@]:3}" # Output: D E
```

Example:

When working with arrays, always use [@] to refer to all elements, and enclose the parameter expansion in quotes to preserve spaces in array elements.


### String Slicing:

In Bash, you can extract portions of a string using slicing. The basic syntax is:

```
${string:start:length}
```

Where:

start is the starting index (0-based) length is the maximum number of characters to extract

```bash
#!/bin/bash

text="LM3NITRO"

# Extract from index 0, maximum 2 characters

echo "${text:0:2}"

# Extract from index 3 to the end

echo "${text:3}"

# Extract 3 characters starting from index 1

echo "${text:1:3}"

# If length exceeds remaining characters, it stops at the end

echo "${text:3:3}"
```

Example:

### Note:

The second number in the slice notation represents the
maximum length of the extracted sub-string, not the ending index. This
is diï¬€erent from some other programming languages like Python. In
Bash, if you specify a length that would extend beyond the end of the
string, it will simply stop at the end of the string without raising an
error.

For example:

```bash
text="Hello, lm3nitro!"

# Extract 5 characters starting from index 7

echo "${text:7:8}"

# Attempt to extract 10 characters starting from index 7

# (even though only 8 characters remain)

echo "${text:7:10}"
```

Even though we asked for 10 characters, Bash
only returns the 8 available characters from index 7 to the end of the
string. This behavior can be particularly useful when you're not sure of
the exact length of the string you're working with.
