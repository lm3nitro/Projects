# Tcpdump Automation

![Pasted image 20241014163054](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e5b4b02-a994-4248-bce9-0631f5409575)

tcpdump is a powerful command-line tool used for network packet analysis. It allows users to capture and inspect the data traffic that flows through a network interface on a system. Itâ€™s also lightweight and flexible, making it ideal for both simple diagnostics and advanced analysis.

### Scope:


### Tools and Technology:
Tcpdump, Linux, and Bash

## Limiting File Size and Amount

Limiting the file size and number of files when using tcpdump can be crucial for several practical reasons, especially in situations where you need to continuously capture network traffic over long periods of time. 

Reasons to implement:
+ Prevent Disk Space Exhaustion
+ Manageability of Capture Files
+ Easier File Transfer and Analysis
+ Efficient Analysis
+ Logging and Long-Term Monitoring

In order to implement a set number of files and file size, I started by creating a service file:

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tcpdump.service
```

In the service file, I entered the following:

```                                                                   
[Unit]
Description=TCPDump Packet Capture Service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/tcpdump -i ens32  -W 10 -C 1 -w /home/elk/pcap/trace.pcap -Z elk
Restart=always
User=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

This will create 10 files at all times of 1 mb each and keep rotating them. 

In order for the configuraiton to be applied, I reloaded the systemd manager configuration:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Enabled the service:

```
sudo systemctl enable tcpdump.service
```

I then verified the status:

```
sudo systemctl status tcpdump.service
```

I then stopped the service:

```
sudo systemctl stop tcpdump.service
```

Restarted:

```
sudo systemctl restart  tcpdump.service
```

Below are the trace files:

# Capturing traffic base on time:



Every 10 secs a trace file will be created with the timestamp.

```
tcpdump -ni ens32 -w tracepcap-%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S -G 10 -Z elk &  
```

Note: The issue with the capturing traffic base on time is that, tcpdump doesn't have a mechanism to keep the files under certain amount.  The only way to keep the file to a specific amount is to delete the files when it reaches the amount of files required.

### Clean up Bash Script:

This script will keep the files to a specific amount.

```

#!/bin/bash

# Directory containing all trace files:
DIRECTORY="/home/elk/pcap"
MAX_FILES=10  # Seting the maximum number of files to keep

# Counting the number of files in the directory:
FILE_COUNT=$(find "$DIRECTORY" -type f -name "trace*" | wc -l)

# Checking if the file count exceeds the maximum number of files to keep
if [ "$FILE_COUNT" -gt "$MAX_FILES" ]; then
    # Calculating how many files to delete
    FILES_TO_DELETE=$((FILE_COUNT - MAX_FILES))

    # Deleting the oldest files
    find "$DIRECTORY" -type f -name "trace*" -printf '%T+ %p\n' | sort | head -n "$FILES_TO_DELETE" | cut -d' ' -f2- | xargs rm -f
fi

```

### Cronjob:

Executing the script every 1 minute.

```
crontab -e

```

# Filtering with BASH:


Reading all pcap files with a for loop:


```
for pcap in /home/elk/pcap/tracepcap*; do tcpdump -nr "$pcap" icmp  ; done 
```

In this case I'm sending ICMP to two destinations IP 1.1.1.1 and 9.9.9.9 , I'm  also reading all the trace files on the right side with a for loop. I was able to read the
