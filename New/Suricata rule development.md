![Pasted image 20241009195326](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbc68079-3124-4b23-bc77-329d3e07b1e5)

Suricata is an open-source network threat detection engine designed for intrusion detection, intrusion prevention, and network security monitoring. It is capable of processing high volumes of traffic in real-time. Here are some key features:

+ Deep packet inspection and packet capture logging
+ Anomaly detection and Network Security Monitoring
+ Intrusion Detection and Prevention, with a hybrid mode available
+ Lua scripting
+ Geographic IP identification (GeoIP)
+ Full IPv4 and IPv6 support
+ IP reputation
+ File extraction
+ Advanced protocol inspection
+ Multitenancy

### Scope:

The scope of this project involves installing Suricata on a VM to serve as a dedicated network intrusion detection and prevention system. This setup allows for easy management and scalability in a controlled environment. After installation, I will create custom rules and will simulate various scans traffic to test the rules effectiveness. I will also monitor and analyze the results through Suricata's alert logs. 

### Tools and Technology:

Ubuntu and Suricata 

## Installation

These are the commands I used to install Suricata, and packages needed:

```
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oisf/suricata-stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install suricata
```

Once Suricata was installed, I went ahead and upgraded to ensure everything was up to date:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade suricata
```

> [!TIP]
> To remove suricata, use the command below
> ```
> sudo apt-get remove suricata
> ```

Once I updated/upgraded the packages, I then updated Suricata's default set of rules:

```
suricata update
```

Next, I needed to configure Suricata. In the screenshot below, I performed the following changes as part of the configuration

+ Enabled pcap logging
+ Disabled suricata.rules and added the local.rule "custom" path
+ Added the network range to the HOME_NET variable:

> [!TIP]
> In order to process/analyze pcap files, the following syntax can be used:
> ```
> suricata -r /home/lm3nitro/pcaps/lm3nitro.evil.pcap
> ```
> An alternative command can be executed to bypass checksums (-k flag) and log in a different directory (-l flag):
> ```
> suricata -r /home/lm3nitro/pcaps/lm3nitro.evil.pcap -k -l .
> ```
> For live input,you can use Suricataâ€™s (Live) LibPCAP mode as follows:
> ```
> sudo suricata --pcap=ens160 -vv

## Suricata Rule Development

### 1. Suricata rule to detect NMAP Ping Sweep:

Created rule:

```
alert icmp any any <> any  any (msg:"Potential ICMP Ping Sweep detected"; itype:8; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 5, seconds 10; sid:1000003; rev:1;)
```

To test against the rule created, I performed a ping sweep with using nmap:

```
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```

Captured the traffic with TCPdump:

I then read the pcap using Suricata:

![Pasted image 20241008160350](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/895e0ae2-9300-482f-89eb-70b9281ec675)

Listing the log files:

Suricata fast.log "alert logs":

based on the output, the rule created worked and it was able to detect the ping sweep performed. 

Taking a look at the pcap file to verify the behavior of the ping sweep:

### 2. Detecting TCP SYN Scans:

Created rule: 

```
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Nmap TCP SYN Scan detected"; flags:S; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 10, seconds 1; sid:1000002; rev:1;)
```
```
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Nmap half-open SCAN)"; flow:to_server,stateless; flags:S; window:1024; tcp.mss:1460; threshold:type threshold, track by_src, count 20, seconds 70; sid:10000001; priority:1; rev:1;)
```

I then performed a SYN Scan with nmap:

```
nmap -sS 10.10.100.1
```

The scan detected 2 open ports:

Capured the traffic with TCPdump, 2388 packets were received:

I then took a look at the Suricata fast.log (alert logs). The output shows the alerts generated by the Nmap scanner:

### 3. Detecting ACK Scans:

Rule created:

```
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Nmap TCP ACK Scan detected"; flags:A; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 10, seconds 1; sid:1000002; rev:1;)
```

Once I created the rule, I performed an ACK San with Nmap to test against it:

### 4. Detecting RST Scans:

> [!TIP]
> Custom Scan Types with --scanflags:
> The --scanflags option in Nmap allows users to specify custom TCP flags for their scan. This option is particularly useful for crafting specialized TCP packets. By default, Nmap uses a set of standard flags for its various scan types. With --scanflags, you can explicitly define which flags to set in the TCP header. For example, you can choose to send SYN, FIN, ACK, or RST flags, among others,

<!-- The --scanflags argument can be a numerical flag value such as 9 (PSH and FIN), but using symbolic names is easier. Just mash together any combination of URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, and FIN. For example, --scanflags URGACKPSHRSTSYNFIN sets everything, though it's not very useful for scanning. The order these are specified in is irrelevant. In addition to specifying the desired flags, you can specify a TCP scan type (such as -sA or -sF). That base type tells Nmap how to interpret responses. For example, a SYN scan considers no-response indicative of a filtered port, while a FIN scan treats the same as open|filtered. Nmap will behave the same way it does for the base scan type, except that it will use the TCP flags you specify instead. If you don't specify a base type, SYN scan is used. -->

```
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Nmap TCP RST Scan detected"; flags:R; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 5, seconds 1; sid:1000003; rev:1;)
```

### Summary:

In implementing Suricata on a VM, the project aimed to enhance network security by developing and testing custom rules against various scans. Through the simulation of network traffic, I was able to evaluate the effectiveness of these rules created, which led to a deeper understanding of Suricataâ€™s capabilities. 

This exercise highlighted the necessity of continuous rule optimization to effectively detect against threats while minimizing false positives. Testing is a crucial component, as it validates the detection capabilities of the rules, informs of adjustments needed based on actual network behavior, and enhances the overall security posture.
