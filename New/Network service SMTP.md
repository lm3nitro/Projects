SMTP stands for "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol". It is utilised to handle the sending of emails. In order to support email services, a protocol pair is required, comprising of SMTP and POP/IMAP. Together they allow the user to send outgoing mail and retrieve incoming mail, respectively.

The SMTP server performs three basic functions:

     It verifies who is sending emails through the SMTP server.
     It sends the outgoing mail
     If the outgoing mail can't be delivered it sends the message back to the sender



We can map the journey of an email from your computer to the recipientâ€™s like this:


1. The mail user agent, which is either your email client or an external program. connects to the SMTP server of your domain, e.g. smtp.google.com. This initiates the SMTP handshake. This connection works over the SMTP port- which is usually 25. Once these connections have been made and validated, the SMTP session starts.

3. The process of sending mail can now begin. The client first submits the sender, and recipient's email address- the body of the email and any attachments, to the server.

4. The SMTP server then checks whether the domain name of the recipient and the sender is the same.

5. The SMTP server of the sender will make a connection to the recipient's SMTP server before relaying the email. If the recipient's server can't be accessed, or is not available- the Email gets put into an SMTP queue.

6. Then, the recipient's SMTP server will verify the incoming email. It does this by checking if the domain and user name have been recognised. The server will then forward the email to the POP or IMAP server, as shown in the diagram above.

7. The E-Mail will then show up in the recipient's inbox.


### Enumerating SMTP:



Nmap:

nmap -sV -sC 10.10.246.91 -nnvvv

nmap --script smtp* -p 25 10.10.246.91 -nnvvv

PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
25/tcp open  smtp  Postfix smtpd
 commonName=polosmtp




### Enumerating with Telnet:


The simplest techniques to query the SMTP server is telnet with VRFY, EXPN and RCPT TO commands, those commands will answer if the username entered exist or not, 252 code if the user exists, 550 code if the user is unknown.

# smtp_version:

Poorly configured or vulnerable mail servers can often provide an initial foothold into a network but prior to launching an attack, we want to fingerprint the server to make our targeting as precise as possible. The smtp_version module, as its name implies, will scan a range of IP addresses and determine the version of any mail servers it encounters.

# smtp_enum

The SMTP Enumeration module will connect to a given mail server and use a wordlist to enumerate users that are present on the remote system.

### Password list:
```

 gnats, irc, landscape, list, lp, lxd, mail, man, messagebus, 
 news, nobody, pollinate, postfix, postmaster, proxy, sshd, sync,

### Using a world list:

set USER_FILE /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames 

 At the end of our Enumeration section we have a few vital pieces of information:

A user account name :
