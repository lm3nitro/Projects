## Change a MAC Address:

Use case:

Privacy and Anonymity: Changing the MAC address can enhance our privacy by preventing tracking based on our deviceâ€™s unique identifier.

Security Testing:  During penetration testing or security audits to simulate different devices on a network. This can help simulate different network scenarios and identify potential vulnerabilities.

The macchanger tool is designed to alter the MAC address of a network interface. It provides a straightforward way to change the unique identifier of a device on a network.
