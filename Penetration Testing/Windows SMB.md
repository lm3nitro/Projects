# Windows SMB

<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-06 at 1 56 51â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e9b8914-9dd1-4b36-9e95-fc864cbba124">

SMB (Server Message Block) is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications, users, or devices to access and manage files on remote servers. In Windows, SMB is primarily used to share files, printers, and serial ports, and it enables seamless access to network resources, making it a core component of Windows networking.

### Scope:

In this exercise, I will scan a Windows host using Nmap to identify open ports and vulnerable services. I will then verify the vulnerability using Tenable, and then exploit it with Metasploit to gain access. Once inside, I will extract password hashes and use John the Ripper to crack them, allowing me to log in as an authenticated user. This simulates a full penetration test, from discovery to exploitation and password cracking.

### Tools and Technology:

Windows, SMB, Wireshark, John the Ripper, Linux, Metasploit, and Tenable

## Getting Started

To get started, I used my Linux VM and ran an nmap scan against a Windows 7 VM in my network on 192.168.91.137:

I can see that ports 135, 139, 445 are open. Knowing that these are open, I then ran all the SMB scripts to see if I could find something. Below are all the NSE scripts related to SMB:

Example of using specify NSE script:

Running all the scripts against the host:

Zoomed in to see the vulnerability better:

## Nessus

Using namp above, I was able to see that the host was vulernable to CVE-2017-0143. Knowing this, I wanted to further confirm and used tenable to run a scan against the host and see what it could find. Tenable was able to find 2 critical vulenrabilities and 1 high:

Lookign further into the vulnerability using tenable, this matches what we found above wiht nmap:

## Metasploit:

Now that I know that this host is vulernable to SMB, I will use Metasploit to execute the exploit against this vulnerability:

HOST and LHOST are parameters that define network targets and your own system's settings. RHOST is the target system and LHOST is my linux machine (attacking system):

set RHOST 192.168.91.137
set LHOST 192.168.91.134

As seen in the screenshot above, the exploit was successful. 

## Wireshark

Using Wireshark while the exploit was running, allowed me to capture and analyze the network traffic, helping to visualize how the exploit behaves behind the scenes. It showed details like packet exchanges, payload delivery, and vulnerabilities being targeted. This helped me to better understand the exploit's impact. 

Below is the traffic capture using Wireshark during the exploit:
