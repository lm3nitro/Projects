Hydra is a brute-forcing tool that helps penetration testers and ethical hackers crack the passwords of network services.

Hydra can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 protocols. This includes telnet, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, databases, and several other services.

A brute force attack is a hacking method that uses trial and error to crack passwords, login credentials, and encryption keys. It is a simple yet reliable tactic for gaining unauthorized access to individual accounts and organizationsâ€™ systems and networks. The hacker tries multiple usernames and passwords, often using a computer to test a wide range of combinations, until they find the correct login information.

# Downloading a wordlist:



Rockyou.txt is a list of over 14 million plaintext passwords from the 2009 RockYou hack. Passwords from this wordlist are commonly used in CTF and penetration testing challenges.

# Launching a dictionary attack:



Dictionary Attack:

If a more sophisticated approach is warranted, a dictionary attack is often used. Here, the attacker is more discerning, wielding a list of common, often used passwords a proverbial dictionary of likely keys. It's akin to someone trying out the most common door codes in a building, hoping that simplicity will lead to success.

# Identify brute force or dictionary  attacks:


Looking at the auth.log on the FTP server to identify password attacks: 

tail -f /var/log/auth.log
