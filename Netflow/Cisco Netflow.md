# Cisco Netflow Configuration


Network management protocols like SNMP allow us to monitor our network. We can check things like cpu load, memory usage, interface status and even the load of an interface. Other tools like NBAR allow us to see what kind of protocols are used.

One of the things we canâ€™t do with those tools is tracking all flows in our network. A flow is a stream of packets that share the same characteristics like source/destination port, source/destination address, protocol, type, service marking, etc.

NetFlow allows us to track these flows on our network. We can use this information to solve problems like bottlenecks, identify what applications are used, how much bandwidth they use etc.

For each of the flows, NetFlow will track the number of packets sent, bytes sent, packet sizes and more. You can configure your router to keep track of all flows and then export them to a central server where we analyze our traffic.

In this labI will show you how to configure NetFlow on a Cisco IOS router and we will take a look at a NetFlow server.

Configuration:

Configuring DHCP for  ***LAN_NETWORK***

Client side DHCP traffic:

On the client:

## Displaying a specific DHCP active lease, or all active leases: 

show ip dhcp binding

NetFlow configuration:

First we have to create a NetFlow profile to assign the IP of the NetFlow collector and the source of the interface we wan to collect from as well as the port


flow exporter lm3nitro_netflow
 destination 172.16.10.10
 source GigabitEthernet0/0
 transport udp 9996


Then we have to configure a monitor interface:

flow monitor lm3nitro_monitor
 exporter lm3nitro_netflow
 record netflow ipv4 original-input


Output from the show running configuration :

Verification :

Applying the monitor NetFlow profile called "lm3nitro_monitor" to an interface:


Note: The command needs to be apply on the actual interface.

ip flow monitor lm3nitro_monitor input

Let's look at information about the flow records that we have, at the moment we don't cache entry:



show flow monitor name lm3nitro_monitor cache

Let's generate some traffic using Zenmap:

Note:

The router is getting DHCP from  a network 172.16.1.0/24 , I'm generating traffic to the Firewall gateway 10.10.100.1 which is located on the "gi0/1 WAN_INTERFACE" Also, Zemmap won't be able to pick up any information from the firewall because it's blocking all the broves:




![Pasted image 20240527120720](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/1bb007ee-1270-4c1f-b9d1-41d047f78376)

Let's check the NetFlow cache again:

NetFlow traffic sent to NetFlow collector by the router:

Details of the flows:

Configurating NAT/PAT on the Cisco Router:


We have to select the interfaces that are outside and inside.



interface gi1/0
  ip nat outside

interface gi0/0
  ip nat inside


![Pasted image 20240527125004](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/856395a8-d067-4cea-980f-bf15adb65be9)



Creating a access list to allow traffic to the translated:

ip nat inside source list 1 interface GigabitEthernet0/1 overload
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 172.16.1.1


![Pasted image 20240527124004](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/85fb07e3-a36e-4f21-a0ce-cd824def2848)


 Creating a static route pointing to  Firewall on172.16.1.1:

Let's look at the NAT translations:


sh ip nat translations

Let's look at our Netflow cache:


We have new cache entries:

![Pasted image 20240527125355](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/794f47d6-b83d-4482-bbe0-0e0e21bfbdb4)




Tracking flows on Gi0/0 interface:


Note:

The ip route-cache flow command  will track all ingress flows on the physical and all sub-interfaces. 

You can also use the ip flow egress or ip flow ingress commands if you only want to enable it on one sub-interface or in one direction.

Let's generate more traffic:
