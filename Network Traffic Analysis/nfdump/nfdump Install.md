# Nfdump

Nfdump is a network flow data collector and analyzer that captures and stores information about network traffic flows in a format that's efficient for analysis. It's useful because it provides insights into network usage and can be used to troubleshoot network issues and detect potential security threats. 

## Installing Nfdump

This is the process I used to get Nfdump installed.

### Install Dependencies:
```
apt install make gcc flex rrdtool librrd-dev libpcap-dev php librrds-perl libsocket6-perl apache2 libapache2-mod-php libtool dh-autoreconf pkg-config libbz2-dev byacc doxygen graphviz librrdp-perl libmailtools-perl build-essential autoconf
```

### Download Nfdump (v1.6.23):
```
wget https://github.com/phaag/nfdump/archive/v1.6.23.tar.gz
```

Untar download:
```
tar xvzf nfdump-1.6.23.tar.gz
```

```
cd nfdump-1.6.23/  
sh ./autogen.sh  
```

```
./configure --enable-nsel --enable-nfprofile --enable-sflow --enable-readpcap --enable-nfpcapd --enable-nftrack  
```
```
make && make install
```

Keep in mind that it may be necessary to run **/sbin/ldconfig** or **ldconfig**Â as root after the installation. Once the install is complete, verify the version:

```
nfdump -v
```

Now that we have nfdump installed, we can utilize it. 

### Converting pcap to nfcapd
```
nfcapd -r ICMP_attack_DoS_attack.pcap -l.
```

Nfdump's filter syntax is comparable to tcpdump but extended for netflow data. It allows for precise data extraction and analysis based on specific criteria (IP addresses, ports, protocols,etc). Additionally, nfdump offers a range of capabilities beyond basic filtering, including the ability to display various top N flow statistics such as top talkers, top services, and top destinations, and more. 

Benefits for threat hunting and incidents response: 

+ Granular Visibility: Nfdump provides granular visibility into network flow data. This allows for analysis of traffic patterns, identifications of anomalies, and detection of potential indicators of compromise (IOCs).
+ Behavioral Analysis: With nfdump's capabilities to display top N flow statistics and flow element statistics,it can be used to conduct behavioral analysis, identifying suspicious activities such as large data transfers, unusual communication patterns, or command-and-control traffic.
+ Alert Verification: Nfdump can also be used to validate/verify alerts generated by intrusion detection systems (IDS) or other security tools by correlating network flow data with security events to determine the legitimacy of alerts.
+ Nfdump can be integrated with threat intelligence feeds, enabling correlation of network flow data with known threat indicators
