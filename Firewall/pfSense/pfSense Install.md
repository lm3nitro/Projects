# pfSense Firewall:

![Screenshot 2024-09-22 at 3 01 29â€¯PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64724515-819f-40b7-a199-9969810b870b)

The pfSense firewall is an open-source firewall and router distribution based on FreeBSD. It is highly regarded for its flexibility, security, and rich feature set, making it suitable for a wide range of networking scenarios, from home networks to enterprise environments. pfSense can be installed on a physical machine or run as a virtual machine, providing advanced networking functions through an easy-to-use web interface.

Here are some key features and capabilities of pfSense:
+ Stateful Packet Inspection
+ Granular Rule Definition
+ Static and Dynamic Routing
+ Multi-WAN (Load Balancing and Failover)
+ OpenVPN
+ IPsec
+ Bandwidth Management
+ Packet Capturing and more

### Scope:
I will be installing the pfSense as part of my lab for learning, experimentation, and improving my network security. I will be demonstrating the steps used to get it installed and running. This will allow me to gain hands-on experience with firewall configuration, rules, and security measures like VPNs, IDS/IPS, and network segmentation.

### Tools and Technology:
Linux, pfSense, and VMWare ESXi

## Downloading Installer

In order to install pfSense, I needed to download the installer directly form the vendor:

## Login

After the installation had completed and the connectivity was good, I then proceeded to sign in into the  Web UI. In my case I navigated to: https://192.168.1.1

![Pasted image 20240515211726](https://github.com/lm3nitro/Projects/assets/55665256/99c9b650-8556-4339-982c-821bdad69597)

Upon login, I checked the Dashboard page and could see that I was receiving traffic on my respective interfaces (LAN and WAN):

## Summary:

I was able to gain hands-on experience with the pfSense firewall. One of the great things about pfSense is how cost-effective and powerful it is.  Now that I have it up and running, I will be able to test some of its features and functionality. I also have other firewalls (Palo Alto and Fortinet), and adding the pfsense will also serve as comparison.
